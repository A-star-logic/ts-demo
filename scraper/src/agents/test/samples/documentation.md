Adding or deleting a single document is fast, but they have a linear index time, while batch operations are. well, less linear.\n# Data sources & poisoning\nThe URL upload is a convenient way to index many documents at once, and can also reduce your egress (Memoire downloads the documents directly from the source instead of you having to send over data).\nHowever, this method can create a vector of data poisoning (aka, bad quality data, false answers, false documents, etc). This is why it will be important for you to verify where those documents are coming from (and please, _PLEASE_, never allow random users to upload their own documents unless you have strong censorship countermeasures).\n> The biggest problem in computing is between the computer and the chair.\n[Previous:Send and search documents](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire/send-and-search-documents)[Next:Troubleshooting, FAQ and contributing on Github](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire/troubleshooting-faq-and-contributing-on-github)\nOn this page:\n[Ingestion speed & batch operations](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire/best-practices#ingestion-speed-batch-operations)\n[Data sources & poisoning](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire/best-practices#data-sources-poisoning)\n# Ready to simplify your RAG pipeline?\n[Book a demo](https://cal.com/mael-abgrall)[Try yourself](https://github.com/a-star-logic/memoire)\nOn social media[ Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/a-star-logic)[ Github ](https://github.com/a-star-logic)\nHelp[ Documentation ](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire)\nIndustries[ E-Commerce ](http://localhost:3000/for/ecommerce)[ Agencies ](http://localhost:3000/for/agencies)\nCompany[About](http://localhost:3000/company)[ Handbook ](http://localhost:3000/company/handbook)\nA\\* Logic | Ansearch\n Copyright Â© 2025, Ansearch Ltd. \n Ansearch Ltd is a company registered in Scotland number SC756179
