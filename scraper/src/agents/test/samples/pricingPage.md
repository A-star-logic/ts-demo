Being default-alive means we will be able to continue growing the business on our terms and have much better investor relations if we choose to take external investment. For you, this means you deal with a much more stable business. \n Once our product becomes cloud-ready, we will offer volume-based prices, so you won't have surprise bills and pay only for what you use. \n# Plan comparison\nHobby\nProduction\n Learning, Hobby projects, Startups[\\*](http://localhost:3000/#startups)\nProduction\n Features \nParse most common documents\nAutomatic optimisation for search\nSearch and retrieval\nSave original documents as text\nChoose your AI model\n Support \nCommunity support\nSlack support\nHelp\n_Online documentation_ \n_\\+ videos_\n White glove service \n \\+ on site if in Glasgow or Edinburgh \n# Oh, and also.\n# \\*Startup programme\nOne year free Production license\nEligibility: Bootstrapped, less than 3 years old\n# Referral perks\n Refer another business, and get both one month free (cumulative) \n# Ready to simplify your RAG pipeline?\n[Book a demo](https://cal.com/mael-abgrall)[Try yourself](https://github.com/a-star-logic/memoire)\nOn social media[ Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/a-star-logic)[ Github ](https://github.com/a-star-logic)\nHelp[ Documentation ](http://localhost:3000/doc/memoire)\nIndustries[ E-Commerce ](http://localhost:3000/for/ecommerce)[ Agencies ](http://localhost:3000/for/agencies)\nCompany[About](http://localhost:3000/company)[ Handbook ](http://localhost:3000/company/handbook)\nA\\* Logic | Ansearch\n Copyright Â© 2025, Ansearch Ltd. \n Ansearch Ltd is a company registered in Scotland number SC756179
