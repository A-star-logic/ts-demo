# *About PostHog*
We help developers build successful products by giving them a suite of products to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. We currently offer product and web analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, a CDP, SQL access, and a data warehouse… and [there’s plenty more to come](https://posthog.com/roadmap).
PostHog was created as an open-source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 110,000 companies have installed the platform. We've had huge success with our paid upgrades, raised $27m from some of the world's top [investors](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors), and have shown strong product-led growth – 97% driven by word of mouth. 
We're growing quickly, but sustainably. We're [also default alive](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html), averaging 10% monthly revenue growth and with more than $10m ARR. We're staying focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring a handful of exceptional team members, and seeing fantastic growth as a result.
# *What we value*
* We are [open source](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-are-open-source)*.* Building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy.
* We aim to become _the_ most transparent company ever. In order to enable teams to make great decisions, we share as much information as we can. In our [*public handbook*](https://posthog.com/handbook)*,* _everyone_ can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, what our strategy is, and who we have raised money from.
* Working autonomously and maximizing impact – we don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what is going to have the biggest impact on our customers.
* Solving big problems – [we haven't built our defining feature yet](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-havent-built-our-defining-feature-yet). We are all about shipping fast, talking to users, and iterating.
# *What you’ll be doing*
Tldr - you'll own paid ads internally. We'll give you a good budget, and you'll spend it as you see fit! But these ads need to be GOOD. You're not just trying to create stuff that's marginally better than our boring competitors - you'll be one of the ways we reach hundreds of thousands of people who may have never heard of us before. So don't be boring.
We currently run ads on Google Search and LinkedIn only, though have tried a bunch of other channels. We also run ads with various newsletter and YouTube creators. 
Obvious things people who have this job do:
* Briefing agency and internal team on ad creatives
* Co-ordinating ad campaigns around major product launches
* Exploring other incentivized growth opportunities (Referrals / affiliates)
* Writing and editing search ad copy
* Creating / collaborating on new landing pages
# *What you won't be doing*
* ❌ Driving incremental tiny changes in CTR/CPA/etc. metrics
* ❌ Doing stuff that is marginally better than other B2B Saas companies
* ❌ We have a designer, but we want you to be creatively opinionated and able to create some variations yourself
* ❌ Executing a standard playbook/spending lots of time briefing/coordinating/reporting
* ❌ Testing 10 different copy variants - use your taste
# *Requirements*
* Strong knowledge and hands-on experience with major ad platforms - Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.
* Be opinionated about what we should do. This will be our first hire into paid ads, so they need to bring strategic clarity and opinions to what we should do.
* Good taste - you need to be a great copywriter yourself.
* Hands-on attitude. We're not looking to build a performance marketing team that needs managing.
# *Nice to have*
* Familiarity in analytics, or similar space. While not essential, someone who understands the competitive landscape we're playing in would be a major benefit.
* You can spin up your own landing pages with limited support from the Website team - and no, we don't use a 3rd party landing page builder.
