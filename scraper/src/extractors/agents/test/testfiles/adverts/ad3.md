# About the role
# About us

* 3+ years of experience engineering across the stack, with a deep understanding of frontend (TypeScript, React, and Next.js) and backend (Python, Flask, Docker, AWS, etc.) languages and frameworks.
* Strong debugging skills
* Scrappiness — you will need to rapidly iterate on customer requests
* Outstanding communication skills
* An understanding of AI systems, or a willingness to learn
# Why Openlayer?
* *High impact*: be part of a team solving critical challenges in AI reliability and trust, shaping how machine learning models are tested and deployed.
* *Growth opportunities*: As part of a fast-growing company, you’ll have ample opportunities to shape your role and grow with us.

# About the interview
Our interview process is designed to be efficient. At each phase, we will be quick to make decisions and will be transparent about our thinking.
The typical interview process takes 2-3 weeks from start to finish, but we have accommodated as short as one week. We are happy to accommodate candidates who might have a short timeline or competing offers. The more information you can share about your situation and where you are in the process, the more we can either attempt to expedite/match, or save you time if we cannot.
# About Openlayer
Openlayer is a testing and debugging platform for machine learning models. Openlayer makes it easy for ML teams to find failures and biases, figure out their root causes, and create unit tests to ensure they stay fixed — all baked in with experiment tracking and versioning (think GitHub for ML). The company was founded by three previous Siri engineers who contributed to over 15 different AI/ML projects at Apple.
Openlayer is currently working with several well-known enterprise companies worth over $1B, helping them rapidly improve the quality of their models and datasets and save tons of time and money.
We're looking for a founding engineer to help us build the future of sustainable, performant, and ethical machine learning.
We're backed by Y Combinator and several of the top investors and funds in the world, including the founders of companies like Instagram, Voyage, Instacart, Sendbird, Mercury.
